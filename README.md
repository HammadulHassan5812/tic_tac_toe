 
# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
### This is a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using JavaFX. The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their respective marks (X or O). The game will declare a winner when a player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If the grid is full and no winner is found, the game will end in a draw.

## Features
###  2-player gameplay: Players alternate turns to place 'X' or 'O' on the grid.
### Winning detection: The game checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.
### Restart functionality: A "New Game" button allows players to reset the game and start fresh.
